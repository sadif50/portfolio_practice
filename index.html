                    I am the master of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I know everything needed to make a website function,
                    efficient. I didn't stop with the web design. I went beyond with most popular JavaScript framework
                    called ReactJS. I even know the deployment.

                <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remote web developer. I made their website and
                    showed
                    it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was a fun working at Programming Hero.</p>
